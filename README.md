Capstone Project Car Accident


Introduction/ Business Understanding

Road accidents are extremely common. Often times they lead to a loss of property and even life. It will be great to understand what are the most common causes, in order to prevent them from happening? With this analysis, I am attempting to understand these factors and their correlation. This analysis will prompt the drivers to be more careful depending on the weather and road conditions on any given day or a way for the police to enforce more safety protocols. In this instance, I am using the data from the City of Seattle’s police department showing all the collisions from 2004 till present.
Stakeholders:
•	Public Development Authority of Seattle
•	Car Drivers
